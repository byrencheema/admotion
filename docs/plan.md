# Admotion Development Plan

## Phase 0: POC (Proof of Concept) ✅ COMPLETE

Basic AI video generation from text prompts.

- ✅ Claude API integration
- ✅ 4-second video generation
- ✅ Single scene videos
- ✅ Basic animations (fade, bounce, gradients)
- ✅ Text and shapes
- ✅ Real-time preview

## Phase 1: Multi-Scene Marketing Videos ✅ COMPLETE

Professional 30-second advertising videos with multiple scenes.

- ✅ 30-second video duration (900 frames)
- ✅ Multiple scenes (4-6 per video)
- ✅ Scene transitions (fade, slide, wipe)
- ✅ Multiple elements on screen simultaneously
- ✅ Coordinated animations with spring/interpolate
- ✅ Scene planning with Claude API
- ✅ Template-based visual composition

## Phase 2: Template-Based Agent System ✅ COMPLETE

Professional template system for guaranteed working video generation.

- ✅ Template-based architecture (Director, Generator, Orchestrator)
- ✅ Claude 3.5 Sonnet API integration
- ✅ 30-second video duration with scene planning
- ✅ Dynamic scene component generation from templates
- ✅ Scene transitions with TransitionSeries
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Template validation and prop injection
- ✅ Self-contained components (no props dependencies)
- ✅ Robust template library (hero, features, CTA, logo)
- ✅ Reset functionality

**Current Status:** Working video generation with some minor timing/display issues in later scenes.

## Phase 3: Dynamic Advertisement Platform

Fully functioning, dynamic, variable-length advertisement generation platform.

### Core Enhancements
- [ ] **Variable video lengths** (15s, 30s, 60s with adaptive scene timing)
- [ ] **Enhanced template library** (20+ scene types)
- [ ] **Dynamic template composition** (mix and match template components)
- [ ] **Brand asset integration** (logos, colors, fonts)
- [ ] **Industry-specific templates** (gaming, luxury, tech, food, etc.)

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Async file operations** (replace synchronous writeFileSync)
- [ ] **Request caching** (cache similar prompts to reduce API calls)
- [ ] **Template compilation caching** (faster generation)
- [ ] **Error boundary components** (better error handling)
- [ ] **Real-time preview** (no page refresh needed)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Smart template selection** (AI chooses optimal templates for content type)
- [ ] **Audio integration** (background music + sound effects library)
- [ ] **Advanced animations** (3D transforms, particle systems, complex transitions)
- [ ] **Brand consistency** (maintain colors/fonts across scenes)
- [ ] **A/B testing** (generate multiple variants)

### User Experience
- [ ] **Preview interface** (scrub timeline, edit scenes)
- [ ] **Template gallery** (browse and select specific templates)
- [ ] **Export options** (MP4, GIF, social media formats)
- [ ] **Analytics dashboard** (template performance metrics)
- [ ] **Batch generation** (multiple videos from CSV)

### Technical Architecture
- [ ] **Service layer refactoring** (separate business logic from I/O)
- [ ] **Template definition files** (JSON/YAML instead of TypeScript strings)
- [ ] **Component caching system** (faster generation)
- [ ] **Database integration** (store generated videos and templates)
- [ ] **API rate limiting** (manage Claude API usage)

## Current Architecture Summary

### How Everything Works Together

**1. User Input Processing**
```
User Prompt → Smart Template Selector → Content Analysis → Template Recommendations
```

**2. AI Agent Pipeline**
```
Template Director (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) → Video Structure Planning
↓
Template Generator → React Component Generation  
↓
Template Orchestrator → File System Management
```

**3. Remotion Video Engine**
```
Generated React Components → TransitionSeries → Remotion Rendering → MP4 Output
```

### Template System Flow

1. **Template Library** (`/src/lib/templates/scene-templates.ts`)
   - 10+ advanced templates with metadata (complexity, style, category)
   - Each template contains React component code with placeholder props
   - Categories: hero, features, cta, logo, product, stats, transition

2. **Smart Selection** (`/src/lib/templates/smart-template-selector.ts`)
   - Analyzes prompt for industry (tech, gaming, luxury, etc.)
   - Maps content to visual styles (futuristic, modern, organic)
   - Generates contextual props (titles, features, stats)
   - Scores templates based on relevance

3. **AI Planning** (`/src/lib/templates/template-director.ts`)
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet receives full template catalog
   - Plans optimal video structure (scenes, transitions, timing)
   - Generates rich, contextual prop values
   - Creates 30-second video flow (900 frames)

4. **Component Generation** (`/src/lib/templates/template-generator.ts`)
   - Injects props into template code placeholders
   - Validates required props and provides defaults
   - Generates TypeScript scene files
   - Creates master composition with TransitionSeries

5. **File Output** (`/src/remotion/`)
   ```
   Generated/GeneratedComp.tsx    # Master composition
   Scenes/Scene1.tsx              # Individual scenes
   Scenes/Scene2.tsx              # ...dynamically created
   ```

6. **Remotion Rendering**
   - Imports generated scenes into composition
   - Applies transitions (fade, wipe, slide)
   - Renders using advanced Remotion features:
     - Spring animations for smooth motion
     - 3D transforms and perspective effects
     - Particle systems with physics
     - Complex interpolations and easing
     - SVG animations and morphing
     - Neon effects and visual filters

### Advanced Features in Use

- **3D Floating Elements** - Perspective transforms with rotation
- **Kinetic Typography** - Word-by-word animations with motion blur
- **Morphing Cards** - 3D card flips with particle effects
- **Neon Pulse Effects** - CSS shadows with dynamic glow intensity
- **Wave Animations** - SVG path morphing with mathematical functions
- **Dynamic Counters** - Interpolated number animations with progress rings
- **Particle Flow** - Physics-based particle movement and opacity

**Result:** Professional marketing videos with advanced visual effects that adapt intelligently to content type and user intent.

**Target:** Enterprise-grade video generation platform for scalable, professional marketing content.
