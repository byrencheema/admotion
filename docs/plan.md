# Admotion Development Plan

## Phase 0: POC (Proof of Concept) ✅ COMPLETE

Basic AI video generation from text prompts.

- ✅ Claude API integration
- ✅ 4-second video generation
- ✅ Single scene videos
- ✅ Basic animations (fade, bounce, gradients)
- ✅ Text and shapes
- ✅ Real-time preview

## Phase 1: Multi-Scene Marketing Videos ✅ COMPLETE

Professional 30-second advertising videos with multiple scenes.

- ✅ 30-second video duration (900 frames)
- ✅ Multiple scenes (4-6 per video)
- ✅ Scene transitions (fade, slide, wipe)
- ✅ Multiple elements on screen simultaneously
- ✅ Coordinated animations with spring/interpolate
- ✅ Scene planning with Claude API
- ✅ Template-based visual composition

## Phase 2: Template-Based Agent System ✅ COMPLETE

Professional template system for guaranteed working video generation.

- ✅ Template-based architecture (Director, Generator, Orchestrator)
- ✅ Claude 3.5 Sonnet API integration
- ✅ 30-second video duration with scene planning
- ✅ Dynamic scene component generation from templates
- ✅ Scene transitions with TransitionSeries
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Template validation and prop injection
- ✅ Self-contained components (no props dependencies)
- ✅ Robust template library (hero, features, CTA, logo)
- ✅ Reset functionality

**Current Status:** Working video generation with some minor timing/display issues in later scenes.

## Phase 3: Dynamic Advertisement Platform

Fully functioning, dynamic, variable-length advertisement generation platform.

### Core Enhancements
- [ ] **Variable video lengths** (15s, 30s, 60s with adaptive scene timing)
- [ ] **Enhanced template library** (20+ scene types)
- [ ] **Dynamic template composition** (mix and match template components)
- [ ] **Brand asset integration** (logos, colors, fonts)
- [ ] **Industry-specific templates** (gaming, luxury, tech, food, etc.)

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Async file operations** (replace synchronous writeFileSync)
- [ ] **Request caching** (cache similar prompts to reduce API calls)
- [ ] **Template compilation caching** (faster generation)
- [ ] **Error boundary components** (better error handling)
- [ ] **Real-time preview** (no page refresh needed)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Smart template selection** (AI chooses optimal templates for content type)
- [ ] **Audio integration** (background music + sound effects library)
- [ ] **Advanced animations** (3D transforms, particle systems, complex transitions)
- [ ] **Brand consistency** (maintain colors/fonts across scenes)
- [ ] **A/B testing** (generate multiple variants)

### User Experience
- [ ] **Preview interface** (scrub timeline, edit scenes)
- [ ] **Template gallery** (browse and select specific templates)
- [ ] **Export options** (MP4, GIF, social media formats)
- [ ] **Analytics dashboard** (template performance metrics)
- [ ] **Batch generation** (multiple videos from CSV)

### Technical Architecture
- [ ] **Service layer refactoring** (separate business logic from I/O)
- [ ] **Template definition files** (JSON/YAML instead of TypeScript strings)
- [ ] **Component caching system** (faster generation)
- [ ] **Database integration** (store generated videos and templates)
- [ ] **API rate limiting** (manage Claude API usage)

**Target:** Production-ready advertisement generation platform capable of creating professional marketing videos for any industry or use case.
